# Foundamental of Machine Learning Algorithm
Here are some typical machine learning algorithm design and implementation:<br/>
1. Binary_Classification: A simple binary classifier implementation <br/>
2. Clustering: A implementation of principle component analysis and kmeans <br/>
3. GDA: A implementation of classifier based on Gussian Distribution Analysis <br/>
4. MLP: A basic three layer multi-layer perceptron implementation <br/>
