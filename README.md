# Foundamental of Machine Learning Algorithm
Here are some typical machine learning algorithm design and implementation:
Binary_Classification: A simple binary classifier implementation
Clustering: A implementation of principle component analysis and kmeans 
GDA: A implementation of classifier based on Gussian Distribution Analysis
MLP: A basic three layer multi-layer perceptron implementation
